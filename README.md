# Outlook Email Validation with Python
This repository was created to explore email validation with Python. It uses [pywin32](https://pypi.org/project/pywin32/) to read emails and their headers from the Outlook desktop client on Windows. It then analyzes the values of the headers to verify the emails against SPF and DKIM protocols. 

Still a work in progress.
